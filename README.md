# SCDTR-Proj

This repository contains the work developed for a Real-Time Cooperative
Decentralized Control of a Smart Office Illumination System, in the curricular
unit of Real-Time Distributed Control Systems from Instituto Superior Técnico.
The system's objective consists of ensuring minimum illuminance requisites,
dependent on the desk’s occupancy, while optimizing energy consumption.

This repository is composed of:
* Consensus_C++ - a folder with the consensus implementation in C++, for
posterior usage in the Arduino micro-controller.
* RPI_Sever - a folder containing the code developed for the server monitoring
the luminaires, implemented in C++ for a Raspberry PI.
* Identification - a folder containing the code used to perform identification
of the system, consisting of MatLab scripts and Arduino code.
* Consensus_MatLab - a folder containing the code used to test the consensus
algorithm

<!-- ## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on
how to deploy the project on a live system. -->

<!-- ### Prerequisites



```
Give examples
``` -->

<!-- ### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo -->


<!-- ## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system -->
